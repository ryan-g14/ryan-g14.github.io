            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                    Hello, My name is Ryan Goss. I am currently a Senior at Vernon Hills High School; and plan to go to college during the fall of 2025. I plan to study History and become a Secondary Education teacher to help the next generation learn and strive in the world. I have previous experience with building computer hardware. Over the summer I built several computers and learned the ins and outs of putting together a computer and what is needed. I also worked and my towns local pool as a cashier. This jobbed gave me new skills such as learning how to proffesionally handle and count money. Aswell as very good customer service skills as I had to deal with many different patrons.

                <h3>Building PC's</h3>
                <p>I started building my PC during the summer of 2023. Although it was confusing at first I enjoyed learning about it. I later went on to learn the ins and outs of the hardware of computers and helped people build there computers as well for experience and for fun.</p>

                <h3>Guardians of the Past | Collab w/ Aarav Dubal</h3>
                <p>Guardians of the Past is a game designed to teach children problem-solving skills while incorporating historical education. By reimagining historical figures, the game introduces players to key moments and individuals from history. Each historical figure will include unique facts, and players will be required to answer history-related questions to progress, blending fun and learning seamlessly.</p>
                <p>As lifelong fans of video games, we appreciate how the series encourages strategic thinking and problem-solving. Adding a historical twist to the game makes it an engaging way to "trick" kids into learning about historyâ€”a subject we find fascinating. This project combines our passion for gaming and education while creating something unique and meaningful.</p>
                <p>Week 6: Currently we are still learning how to program within Unreal Engine. We have faced roadblocks in figuring out how to use unreal engines program as we have found it to be a little confusing. However, thanks to our mentor Andrew Shulman we have found a way for us to be more efficient. The first thing he recommended doing is switching from unreal engine to UEFN. UEFN is pretty much unreal engine but it is coded within Fortnite. This will allow us to have an easier time creating the game as it already has many more preloaded devices allowing for us to have to do a lot less work overall. The other thing we were told to do was split our work up into two different parts. So I will be creating the world and building the world and Aarav will be making the character and make sure they are able to interact with the world properly. </p>
