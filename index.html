            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                    Hello, My name is Ryan Goss. I am currently a Senior at Vernon Hills High School; and plan to go to college during the fall of 2025. I plan to study History and become a Secondary Education teacher to help the next generation learn and strive in the world. I have previous experience with building computer hardware. Over the summer I built several computers and learned the ins and outs of putting together a computer and what is needed. I also worked and my towns local pool as a cashier. This jobbed gave me new skills such as learning how to proffesionally handle and count money. Aswell as very good customer service skills as I had to deal with many different patrons.
